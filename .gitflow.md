# GitFlow Configuration for Examen CI/CD Project

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features

### Supporting Branches

- **feature/\***: New features (e.g., feature/user-authentication)
- **release/\***: Release preparation (e.g., release/v1.0.0)
- **hotfix/\***: Critical fixes (e.g., hotfix/security-patch)

## Workflow

### Feature Development

1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Develop feature with tests
3. Create pull request to `develop`
4. Merge after CI pipeline passes

### Release Process

1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Final testing and bug fixes
3. Merge to `main` and `develop`
4. Tag release version

### Hotfix Process

1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Fix critical issue
3. Merge to `main` and `develop`
4. Deploy immediately

## CI/CD Integration

### Triggers

- **Push to main**: Full deployment pipeline
- **Push to develop**: CI pipeline only
- **Pull requests**: CI pipeline for validation

### Environments

- **Staging**: Auto-deploy from `develop`
- **Production**: Auto-deploy from `main`

## Commands

```bash
git flow init

git flow feature start feature-name

git flow feature finish feature-name

git flow release start 1.0.0
